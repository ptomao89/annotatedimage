        <p>Jeanne Owens is a 73 year old pensioner, New York native and transit activist from Jamaica, Queens. Owens began her political advocacy in 2016,  fighting for express buses to serve the Allen Cathedral Senior Residences where she is a resident. Owens is active in the Riders Alliance, which is how we first connected with each other. Prior to moving to the senior residences, Jeanne was homeless for six years, it was during that time the bus became her lifeline.  Owens penchant for speaking up is rooted in her union activism. A former La Guardia airport worker, Owens was a member of the Communication Workers of America, Local 1032 from 1996 - 2006, where she also served as an union officer.  </p>

        <p> In April, I followed Jeanne as she took her bi-monthly shopping trip to Forest Hills. It takes three buses to get from her Jamaica, Queens apartment complex to Austin Street. The trip is an hour long, one way. The same journey by car would be 24 minutes. Like Jeanne, many seniors in her building struggle with mobility, but the bus is often unreliable. Illegally parked cars prevent the bus from fully pulling to the curb, snarling traffic and delaying the bus. The blocked curbs also impede seniors from accessing the vehicle, since the bus can’t fully lower itself for passengers. Jeanne's experience is representative of many transit riders in New York City. 75% of New York bus routes get a grade of D or F according to nonprofit TransitCenter. The low grade reflects poor reliability, long wait times and infrequent schedules.   </p>

        <p>There are a number of things cities can do to make buses more efficient. This includes creating dedicated bus lanes, expanding limited stop service,implementing all door boarding and increasing frequency of service. Access to transportation is increasingly tied to social mobility–making investments in the bus system crucial for working class New Yorker’s. Policy over city streets is controlled by the mayor and city council.  A focused city government could transform how residents get around. </p>
