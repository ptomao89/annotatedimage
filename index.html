        <p>Jeanne Owens is a 73 year old transit activist from Jamaica, Queens. Jeanne lives in the Allen Cathedral Senior residences and relies on the bus to daily errands. It takes Jeanne 2 buses to get to Jamaica LIRR station. Jeanne is a former union officer and began speaking up for better bus service 6 years ago. Jeanne was  homeless for 6 years but that hasn't dampened her can do attitude or belief in speaking up for what's right. Jeanne is active in the Riders Alliance, which is where we first connected</p>

        <p>Last month I profiled Ms. Jeanne as she took her usual trek to get to Forest Hills. It takes 3 buses to get to and from Forest Hills and often over an hour.  Transportation access has been increasingly linked to to social mobility, in fact it is the leading indicator in someones odds of escaping poverty.  Improving transit is a civil rights issue. Even though many seniors in Jeanne's building have mobility issues, the bus is often unreliable and is blocked by illegally parked cars from pulling to the curb   </p>

        <p>Homeownership has been the traditional way for middle class families to build wealth in post-war America. A home is usually a family’s single greatest investment and asset.  But Black Americans have been systematically carved out of homeownership. </p>

        <p> Until the late 1940’s racially restrictive deeds blocked African Americans from moving into high opportunity neighborhoods. After World War II, Blacks were denied the same low interest government backed mortgages given to White families. Mortgages that were used to purchase homes in the suburbs. Today, many White families have accrued a generations worth of home equity, all from government aid denied to African Americans.  
               </p>

        <p> This disparity in homeownership plays a role in fostering the racial wealth gap. The net worth of the average White family is now 10 times greater than that of a Black family.   Increasing Black homeownership and investing in Black homeowners is essential to closing that gap. The hot pandemic housing market and subsequent decline in Black homeownership threatens to make the gap worse. </p>
