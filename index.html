        <p>Nationally, 44% of Black Americans own homes compared to 73% of Whites, a nearly record high gap. In Albany, the  gap is the second widest in the nation, after Minneapolis: 68.9% of Whites own homes compared to 20.1% of Black residents. The divide stems from government policies that blocked African Americans from the housing market in the post-World War II era. 
             </p>

             <p>The consequence of those discriminatory housing policies is felt decades later. Fewer Black families own homes and have access to the economic benefits of homeownership. In turn, with home prices appreciating at faster than ever before, Black families are disproportionately locked out of those gains.</p> 

              <p> “We’ve seen existing homeowners grow their home equity by $3.2 trillion, we know that growth hasn’t been shared equally,” said Nikitra Bailey, senior vice president of public policy at the National Fair Housing Alliance.  “What we have seen during this time is that covid policies have really exacerbated existing inequities in homeownership and wealth.”</p>

        <p>Homeownership has been the traditional way for middle class families to build wealth in post-war America. A home is usually a family’s single greatest investment and asset.  But Black Americans have been systematically carved out of homeownership. </p>

        <p> Until the late 1940’s racially restrictive deeds blocked African Americans from moving into high opportunity neighborhoods. After World War II, Blacks were denied the same low interest government backed mortgages given to White families. Mortgages that were used to purchase homes in the suburbs. Today, many White families have accrued a generations worth of home equity, all from government aid denied to African Americans.  
               </p>

        <p> This disparity in homeownership plays a role in fostering the racial wealth gap. The net worth of the average White family is now 10 times greater than that of a Black family.   Increasing Black homeownership and investing in Black homeowners is essential to closing that gap. The hot pandemic housing market and subsequent decline in Black homeownership threatens to make the gap worse. </p>
